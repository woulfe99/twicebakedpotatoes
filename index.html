   This is Alan's favourite dish because who doesn't like potatoes? or cheese? or bacon? With so few ingredients and a tiny bit of dedication you can have a wonderful side dish or meal that you can use to impress your friends, your mom, your dog, whatever. Definitely your dog. This dish is delicious and simple. That's why it's Alan's favourite dish because Alan can't cook. Until now.
